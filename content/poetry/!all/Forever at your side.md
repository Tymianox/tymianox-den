I know it's hard
I know you're sad
And when you beat yourself up
I'm always there to patch you up

When you can't stop overthinking,
Overanalyzing, overexplaining
I'm there to reassure you again
I'm there to hold you together


In the depths of night, when stars align
I'll be your guiding light, forever thine
Through the storms that life may bring
In your heart... I'll always sing

So when the world feels cold and dark
Know that I'll be your eternal spark
Because you are there for me still
Whenever I feel like nothing is nil
