> If by the Victory all we mean is a broken and brooding foe;
Is the pomp and power of a glitt'ring hour, and a truce for an age or so.
By the clay-cold hand on the broken blade we have smitten a bootless blow!
— Robert William Service "The Song Of The Pacifist"

What for are all the wars?
What for a single victory?
What does it show to others?
That our sword is sharper?

Why are piles of dead
A sign of success?
Why are mothers' howls
A triumphant fanfare?

Is the greatest honour
To be drenched in foe's blood?
Is our mind too weak
To create a better route?

And when time comes
For another bloody war
We stand next to our former foe
Isn't that somewhat —
                  Hypocritical?
