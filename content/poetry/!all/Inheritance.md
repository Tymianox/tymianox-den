When we leave this forsaken world,
What will we leave behind?
Will we leave a new generation?
Will we leave a broken person?
Will we leave a fortune for others?
Will we leave an unreturnable IOU?

What will have our lives been?
What will our destiny thus be?
What in the infinite sea
Of possibilities will we choose?
Epicureanism or
Immortal inheritance?
