I need to be alone
no one can touch me
no one can know me
no one can help me

don't get close
you will get hurt
at least I think so â€”
I'm not taking any chances

leave me be
it's for the better
you won't help
and I won't get better

don't talk to me
I won't respond
or I'll bark something back
I have to be alone so no one gets hurt
