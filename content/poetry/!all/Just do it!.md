   Pull it
Pull the trigger
   Do it
Do the laughter
Let the world know
Who you truly are

   Jump off
If you really really want
   Break off
From the ones you don't love
Let the world know
   Who you truly are

   Survive
Through the bullying & spite
   Strive
For what you want in life
Let the world know
Who you truly are

   Cry
When you feel depressed
   Fly
When your heart's a butterfly
Let the world know
Who you truly are

   Laugh
When you're truly happy
   Gaffe —
Don't worry about that
Let the world know
Who you truly are


Don't worry about the scowl and glower
Just be who you are
Live life to the fullest
Cause you don't know what's next
