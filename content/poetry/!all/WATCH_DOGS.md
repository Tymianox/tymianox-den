Who is this guy
He's sharp as a tack
I know because he can hack
He can fight
And you know that's right
And he can parkour
And I bet there's more
AND he can climb ladders[^1]
He's better than Blackadder

Sneaking in the night
Security's fright
DedSec's fighter spy
People's greatest ally
Guerilla of the future
A joining suture
Battling Blume
So society can bloom
