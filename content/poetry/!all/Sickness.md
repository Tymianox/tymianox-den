My throat is burning
And I breathe fire
That could burn you
In a few weeks time
I gasp for air
Only for it to be punched out of me
Every time
Every bone o' mine hurts
Like if it were spun around
One-eighty degrees
And in every joint there's a nail
Twitching with every stimuli 
A crown of thorns appears
And disappears randomly
On my overclocking head
Something squirms in my abdomen
Trying to get out
Run away
Be free

Death would be nice
Right about now
Agony - a lighter cross to bear
