something’s wrong
i move my body but i freeze
it feels like something’s taking over
and i am defenceless
i’m losing all my senses
my thoughts feel like they’re caged
and someone threw away the key
i try to talk to myself
but the voice sounds like someone else
i think my mind is broken

i don’t feel like myself
i think i might be something else
i can’t tell if i’m dreaming
i’m feeling like an animal
will i make it through this delusion
or is this evolution?
i have become something new
i’m like a creature from a nightmare
