Hey you 🫵!
Come on! Join in!
Join in on the fun!

Come dance with us,
Let go of your worries,
Forget the darkness for now,
Come on, join in on the fun!

Look at it through my eyes:
There's no point in crying over spilt milk,
Unless you cry tears of milk (which I doubt),
So set it all aside, just for today.

Let it all out!
Move your body to the sound.
Shake off all the demons,
Show them they have no hold.
