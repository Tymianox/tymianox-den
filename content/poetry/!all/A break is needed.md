What you love
Can hurt you hard
If you don't
Take a break sometime

And let your heart unwind
For if you don't, it might
Break into pieces fine.

Embrace the silence,
And let the healing start
For what you love so deeply
Should never tear you apart.

So take a step back
And clear your mind and soul
For what you love so deeply
Should always make you whole.
