in the hot fiery depths of Hell's abyss
where your screams in vein can no more be heard 
you ask the devil -- when will the pain end?
and hear -- when all of the existence ends

deep in the empty & dark Underworld
another endless and eternal abyss
a squeaky voice can be heard
from Tartarus -- when will their sick reign end

in the Norse Niflheim where Hel exacts cold rules
where darkest souls wait shrouded in dark mist
wherein is the end? where's the Ragnar√∂k?
we want to fight and kill Valhalla's sons

   why every soul asks of the end of time
   Death says -- I'm tired of this, cut the crap
