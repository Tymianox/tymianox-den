My eyes are set on the far horizon
Nothing can obscure my vision
I finally understand my life's goal
And I shall complete it whole

No matter the hardship
No matter the hindrance
My life is a merchant's ship
Traveling through turbulent waters
Traveling from port to port
Selling goods and giving all joy
