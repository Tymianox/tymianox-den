Constant mumbling  
Inside my mind  
Thoughts churning  
Around same things  
Without pause  
Without reason  
Without conclusion  
  
Constant yapping  
All day, all night  
Thoughts circling  
No peace at all  
Without grounds  
Without remorse  
Without mercy  
  
My mind feels alien  
Like a third eye  
From Cthulhu  
Given with no ask  
Without  
Without  
Without...
