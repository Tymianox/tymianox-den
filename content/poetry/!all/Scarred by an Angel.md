You are no angel to me
You broke me one last time
I won't care no more
At least I'll say so
And no I wasn't born
With all these scars
They're reminders
Of battles I got through
Like the one with you
Can you blame me?
It's better than putting
My heart together
From pieces

I know my silence hurts
But what can I say
To all the hurt I face
It's a small price to pay
Being heartless is better
Than having your heart
In pieces

Now you say you're a nightmare
And I wouldn't mind
If I could lend you a hand
But you cut it off instead
So I'll hide, lick my wounds away
It's better than having my heart
In pieces

So can you blame me?
No, I didn't think you can
