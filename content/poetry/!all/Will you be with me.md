Are you who I need?
Are you who I searched for the world?
Are you who I looked for all life long?

Will you tell me that
If I show you a chamber of my worst secrets
Filled with incomplete diary entries
And forgotten memories
Of gorgeous sunsets spent alone?

Will I hear poetry on you lips?
Will you be the demise of the undead
Haunting & poisoning all my thoughts?
Will you be counting with me our last breaths
When it all comes to an end?


Will you be with me?
