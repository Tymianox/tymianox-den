What will I eat
When my cupboards are bare
What will I eat
When all my provisions are spent

What will I eat
When I'm stuck on a peak 
What will I eat
When I break a rib

What will I eat
When the fridge breaks down
What will I eat
When a storm comes down

What will I eat
When the rivers have run dry
What will I eat
When the earth is barren and void

What will I eat
In this desolate land
What will I eat
At the end of times

What will I eat
When the darkness comes
What will I eat
When the world breaks down

I'll eat hope and love
I'll feed on my dreams
I'll feast on the light of the stars
And the warmth of the sun's rays

For as long as I have hope
And the will to survive
I'll find a way to nourish my soul
And keep my spirit alive.
