Who needs a grave?
Why would we want people
To bother us after death?
Haven't we had enough?
All the talking, all the lies
Do we have to listen to them 
Even in the afterlife?
I want to be one with nature 
With the ground
And with the breeze
Lay me under a linden tree
And let me be free of humanity
