It's September again
It's getting cold again
It's so miserable again
It's going to be hard again

I see the abandonment of desires
The crickets in our closet are going quiet
Fireflies in my heart are getting darker
Our hearts of stardust starting to crumble
A weightless love falling to the ground
I think my heart is out of order

Do I still have a home in your heart?
I need your help to rekindle the candle of love
'Cause it's September again & depression's kicking in
I won't be able to love you with all the weight on my back
So I ask of you to start with me over
When September is over
