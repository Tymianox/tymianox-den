Our love used to be sharp like a razor
But now we've broken hearts with blunt edges
From them love spilled all over the world
Someone has to leave first, this can't go on
  
And I'm afraid I can't do it, 'couse even tho
My heart's broken, it still yearns for you
The fire in my ribcage didn't die out
If anything it burns even brighter

Longing is my middle name
Even if I find another soul
I'll still remember you
'Till the day I finally dieÂ 

Maybe I'm cursed to love
What I cannot ever reach
