You've heard about enemies to lovers
How about a reversal of status quo
We were friends, then lovers
But your head got ahead
Now you hate me, cause why not?

Tell me, how does it feel to breathe
When you're dead?
Does it feel like a truck's on your chest?
It's the same when you love who you hate
Did you cool off, are your priorities straight?

Well now it's too late
You will rot in your grave
While I search for someone
Who won't contradict their claims
Who won't hate me for being

Who. I. Said.
