as long as my heart keeps beating
my love for you won't be slowing

it'll be as fast as a hurricane

it'll help keep me sane

it'll be bright as sun's glow

it'll give me strength
to keep living without foresight

my reasons might be lame
i just hope your feelings are same

so let's stay together



forever and ever and ever
