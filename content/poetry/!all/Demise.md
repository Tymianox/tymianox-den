A man, descending into madness
Grasping at the last strands of sanity
In his head a turmoil of thoughts
"Why, has my life turned into this"
He thinks, trying to stay aware
His emotions melting into one
His life slowly seeping away
His heart slowing down
His eyes getting heavy
His breath fading
   Her cold, welcoming touch

When one's time comes
They are never ready
They will kick and bite
With all their might
For every second of life
Not for their family
Not for their friends
For their own sake
