It's harrowing,
When a friend turns their back,
And zips their mouth shut.

Have you hurt them?
Or is it something else that cuts?

The silence deafening,
Leaves us lost and unsure,
Was it something we said,
Or something we failed to do before?

The questions haunt us,
As we try to make amends,
To bridge the gap,
And regain our once-close friends.

But sometimes, despite our efforts,
The bond cannot be restored,
And we must accept,
That our friendship is no more.

So cherish those you hold dear,
And never let them slip away,
For the pain of losing a friend,
Is a heavy price to pay.
