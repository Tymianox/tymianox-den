We lived in our village peacefully
As we have for hundreds of years
Our lives went by lazily and slowly
And then began the climb upstairs

A dragon named Blitz appeared
Our land has been all seared
Our crops been burned to ash
Half of the homes been made flat
We feared for our lives as drought
Began, but there was still some hope

A wizard came with plenty of power
And brought back our destroyed homes
Allowed us to freely in grain shower
Saved our land from coming catacombs
