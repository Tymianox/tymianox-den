*And now Mark, can you tell us about your sleep paralysis demon?*

Um, yes, so...
My demon is less of a demon
And more of an eldritch creature
Eldritch creature with a bright pink shal

Why do I think so?
It's the atmosphere, how it behaves
And I've never seen it fully
It just watches from outside the window

How do I cope?
Well, to be honest it's just kind of... nice?
It often says things like "Be not afraid"
"I'm here to help", "Talk to me"
It's just that I'm paralyzed
And it's sheer size
That's the problem
