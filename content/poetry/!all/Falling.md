Falling backwards
With my arms open to the world
Clouds reflecting in my eyes
Bliss entombing me fully

Falling downwards
With my arms open as a cross
Clouds reflecting in the windows
I know the ground is getting closer

Falling as a being
With my arms open to what will come
Clouds reflecting in my heart
I think she's getting close

Falling as a person
With my arms open to embrace death
Clouds reflecting in her eyes
No life's flashing before my eyes,
Nothing's concealing her form
