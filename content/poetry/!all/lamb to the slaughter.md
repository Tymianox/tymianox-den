they dressed me in white
soft as wool, pure as sin
led by hands I trusted
led by eyes I never knew

to a place where shadows linger
past the fields of sweet, warm sun
to a silence that was thicker
than the chains theyâ€™d soon begun

i walked the path so freely
unaware of blood or blame
blindly to the slaughter
in a sacrificial game

the knife came quick and quiet
no warning from the stars
a lamb to the slaughter
unaware of the signs
