C'mon gents & galls
We're gonna party
Like in the good ol' times
We're gonna party
Like it's 1929

Don't listen to the cannons
Don't mind the war cries

Let's enjoy our lives
And party like it's 1929
Let's keep on swingin'
Let's stop worryin'

Just keep partyin'
'Cause our lives are short
Let's enjoy them
While we still can
