> Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars and change the world.
– Harriet Tubman

We will all some day die,
So let's use the time we still have
To live a life we will remember,
So we won't forget what we have done.

Don't worry with others expectations,
Live a life you dream of at night.
Etch your name into the ground
That birthed you to this world.
