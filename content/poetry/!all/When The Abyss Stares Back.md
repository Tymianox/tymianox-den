I stare into the abyss
For more than 18 years
Looking for any bliss
When the world provided
None

The abyss peeps back
From time to time
Only thing that gives a fuck
The thing that is no
Thing

I start to see behind the veil
What beyond comprehension
Lies, no longer can I wail
No longer can I look anywhere
Else

I see inside swirling nothing
With nothing, more nothing
And nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing
None

The nothing that is and isn't
Exists and does not
The absolute being
That a being is
Not
