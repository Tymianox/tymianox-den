i donâ€™t want a marble stone
to mark my days and mourn my bones
let my words be roots that spread
lay me where the wildflowers bloom

no grand eulogies or songs
let my voice be where it belongsâ€”  
in the rustle of the leaves
in the sighs of evening breeze

plant me â€˜neath a willowâ€™s shade
so I might weep with 'er when skies are greyed
or under starsâ€™ soft silver light
we'll reminisce on times gone past

let my rest be soft and true
as lines I wrote in solitude
no grave to keep, no tomb to see
just let my words remember me
