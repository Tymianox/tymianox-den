Stranded strangers
In an indifferent world
Full of dangers
Towards us hurled

We're looking through
Detached empty crowds
Finding only a few
Cold hearts and warm tongues

Even if it was never meant to be
We'll still find ourselves
If we search through debris
In the neverending sea of thieves

And after we find each other
Our estranged souls
We can be lonely together
Filling our painful holes
