Take me to my utopia
Couse I've been here forever
We're gonna dance
Till we no longer can

What do you seeing in me
Couse I see everything in you
Is it my eyes, hands or hair?
Is it my smile, mind or heart?

I know I'm not perfect but
I wanna be perfect for you
And I'll do anything I can
To make you feel perfect too

So take me to your utopia
Couse I've been here forever
We're gonna dance
Till we no longer can
