Simply a container  
For rage and blood  
Easily shattered  
When poked  
  
Cracks form, unseen at first  
But growing wider with each curse  
I overflow, a death's flood  
Spilling all my fractured worth  
  
Held together by thin seams  
I ache beneath the weight of dreams  
Yet I am just a fragile shell  
A vessel for a fleeting hell
