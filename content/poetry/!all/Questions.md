On a bus.
In my bed.
At school.
While eating.
In a store.
At the beach.
At work.
On a chill walk.

Questions about life,
Appear from time to time.
I can't make them go away,
No matter what I try.

...
I'm afraid...
Afraid they'll stay...
They'll stay and haunt me...
Haunt me till the day I finally die.
