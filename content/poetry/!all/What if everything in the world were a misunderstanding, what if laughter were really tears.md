Questions linger,
like whispers in the night's cool air,
In their silent echoes,
we seek what's truly there.

What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding?
What if laughter were really tears?

Behind the mask,
an abyss conceals the truth,
We hunt for answers,
within the shadows of our youth.

A deeper look beyond our painted facade,
A deeper meaning behind those cheerful eyes.
