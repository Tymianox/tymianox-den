the beauty in destruction
takes my breath away

shimmering, sparkling colors
of supernovae
their slow, inevitable progress
yet still sudden
almost instant it'd seem
the intricate web
of celestial â€“ as if holy â€“ gas
inside â€“ a tiny black dot
while charming
she guards her secrets with might
unknown to mankind

moons, shattered by tidal waves
their frozen remains
forming glimmering rings
any who look at them
are stopped in their tracks
to forever admire them

the illusiveness of quasars
the majesty of supervolcanoes
the slender silhouettes of bombs
the soft glow of nuclear explosions
the modus operandi of serial killers
the intricacies of human minds




the beauty in destruction
