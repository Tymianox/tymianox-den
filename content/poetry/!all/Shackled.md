Chains everywhere.  
  
Can't look up â€”
Only down  
At the ground,  
Scorched, cracked,  
Blighted and battered.  
  
Can't see, but feel â€”
Giants stomping all around.  
Can't see, but hear â€”
Others' squashed sounds.  
  
Chained, can't move,  
Run or fight;  
Awaiting a saviour,  
Or Death, to come.
