Tap, tap, tap, tap,
Raindrops fall flat.
Splish-splash, splish-splash,
On windows they clash.


When sitting at home,
I hear a silent knock.
'Is someone at the door?
But why would they knock?'

I look through the spyhole
To see a raincloud form,
I invite it right inside:
'Make yourself at home.'

'You want water? Sweets pile?'
'Thanks, but I've got mine.'
It says with a slight smile
As it slumps on the armchair.

'So, how's life? Hope it's treating you right,
Wouldn't want you breaking down.
Is your work coming together alright?
Anything that keeps you up at night?

'It's fine I guess, not much to say.
No need to worry, I'll be fine.
Work's going slow, but onward in a way.
There's still some things, but quiet right now.'

'I'm glad you're keeping it together,
Not many people would not fall apart.'
'I've fallen many times down nether.'
'But you've climbed up every time.'


With the rain softly tapping,
We exchange more thoughts.
With the sun coming out,
It's time for rain to go where it's sought.

'See you soon, don't stop dreaming.'
'Thank you, I won't. Goodbye.'
As a rainbow slowly appears,
Rain hides behind the sky.

To visit another lonely soul.
