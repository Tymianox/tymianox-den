Wires in place of veins  
Iâ€™ve forgotten how to feel  
The world outside is fading  
Nothing here is real  
  
Tethered to a hollow void  
Every movementâ€™s not my own  
In empty silence I kneel  
A marionette, alone  
  
The light is dim, the air is cold  
I wonder where Iâ€™ve gone  
I am a shell, a hollow doll  
Lost inside this game
Alone
