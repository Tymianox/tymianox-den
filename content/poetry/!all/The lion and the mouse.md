In the tangled net of fate, the lion roared,
Majestic but ensnared, a fool to fate's cruel jest.
His strength is great, yet not enough,
Struggles 'neath the weight, in darkness oppressed.

Approached the mouse, an unlikely savior,
A timid presence, in the depths of night.
Tiny yet bold, it did not waver,
Nimbly it gnawed, in silence, uncontrolled.

The lion, once fierce, now humbled, understood,
In the darkest hour, it's the meek who could.
