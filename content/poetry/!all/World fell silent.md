The world became mum
In my time of woe
No one made a sound
No one said a word

When I needed help
The world was silent
I dug by myself
To get back out whole

So I found a scoop
And got to my work
Stopping what would droop
Fixing all the holes

Soon I found a glue
To repair what I
Thought bid me mute adieu
In what? You can dream


While it's not all right
It is still better
And I would not change
Even a quarter
