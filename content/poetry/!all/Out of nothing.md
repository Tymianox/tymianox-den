At one moment there's nothing
The next - a word 
Then - a thousand
And between those words
Some sense
Some meaning
I do not yet see

Another moment - words coagulate
Like blood out of my veins
Meaning still unknown
But gaining in weight
And as time goes
The lines make themselves
And I understand the meaning
I get the sense
