Awaking in bed
Eating some bread
Fighting off the dread
   Why do I do this?

Going to work
Getting overwork'd
Pushing through murk
   Why is it like this?

Meeting a friend
Waiting for the end
Getting ready to defend
   Why am I like this?

Going back home
Dining on a dome
Waiting for the gloam
   Why does this happen?

Finding some peace
   Why am I still here?
   Living through the
   Mundane moments
