Traveling to distant stars
On a rail made of light
Leaving behind human blight
Hoping to lick my wounds and scars

As I sail throughout the Void
Thoughts, my companion only
Yet I know I won't be lonely
With the memories from my Polaroid

I'll heal these open scars
And leave behind the night
I'll make peace with contrite
Between these freeing railcars

> Take this as my memoir
> You won't hear from me, Cinnabar
