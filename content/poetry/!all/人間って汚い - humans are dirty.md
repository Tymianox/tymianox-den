on the shore I stand
in black, in shame
don't want to look
at all the decay

wind whispers quietly
of vast carelessness
the sky hangs low
doesn't weep - anymore

the mermaid looks - to the horizon
for mercy, salvation
neither comes
to the laboratorial freak

we wait without breath
weep without tears
among the silence
among the filth
