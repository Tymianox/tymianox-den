Sometimes I still wait
For you to tell me about your day
Because I forget 
We haven't talked for a long time

Sometimes I'd like to hear you laugh
But now it'd seem fake
It all feels like a dream
And I want to go back to sleep

Sometimes I wonder
If we were ever really friends
Or if we only thought that 
Because we had nothing better left
