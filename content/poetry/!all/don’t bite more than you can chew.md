you take the world in greedy bites
unfolding dreams too large to hold
you chase the stars with reckless strides
but every step leaves behind some cold

you build your towers high on hopes
on fragile bones and sandstone cliffs
you grasp for more than hands can hold
and find your grip is frail, untrue

you bite off more than you can chew
and find it’s more than you can rue
