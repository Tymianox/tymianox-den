## 𝕀
Come comrades
We'll conquer all
We'll bring our enemies
To their knees low

We'll bring light
Onto this dark world
We'll make peace
For the people

No matter the cost
We'll come out on top
We'll not fall down
And we will thrive

We'll strike down
Eastasia and Eurasia
Who've flown to havens
'N' teach 'em who's B̵̮͍̲̦̓o̸̱͐s̵̥̙̗͈̹̈̾̓̽s̸̢̧̻̐͌͑͒

## 𝕀𝕀
I see through your lies
You won't deceive me
I'll start a 𝖗𝖊𝖛𝖔𝖑𝖚𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓
To stop your tyranny

The Big Brother will die
Thought Police will stop
We'll end this eternal war
For our children's sake

Wake up people
We have to act
Before it's too late
Before we lose ourselves
