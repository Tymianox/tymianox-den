Smile, silly  
No need to worry  
I don't deal in chicanery  
Only in souls, darling  
  
It's a fair trade, you see?  
I get your soul  
You get what you wish  
See what I mean?  
  
You want to be free from reality  
And I can arrange that dear  
We both get what we want  
What is there to think about?

Ah, thank you very much
I'm always happy to help
Now hop on in
I hope you enjoy your stay with me
