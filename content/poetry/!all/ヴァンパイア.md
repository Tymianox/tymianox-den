This blood - revitalizing
This pain - mesmerizing 
This feeling - cauterizing 
This addiction - arising

The cuts appear every day
Blood flows like water - or ale
I thank you for it
But I worry for your health

Your light is fading my friend
You cannot keep doing this to yourself
I don't know if love or hunger
Binds me to you

Shall we try to break free
Of this cursed macabre 
You will have your life
I will sate my fangs
