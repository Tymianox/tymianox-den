You left me in a ditch for dead
And her to rot from what you said
This time you crossed the line
I won't show mercy no more
'Cause...

You're E-V...🫢 E-V-I-L 😮‍💨
Won't help you no more
'Cause we're not friends 
You better run away

I know it's not your fault
You were raised this way
But I just don't care
Since you thought it was ok
'Cause...

You're E-V...🫢 E-V-I-L 😮‍💨
You better run away
I won't stop the chase
Until you meet your end

You let yourself hurt me
You know how I am
When I've had enough
And now you'll pay
'Cause...

You're E-V...🫢 E-V-I-L 😮‍💨
Won't help you no more
'Cause we're not friends 
You better run away
