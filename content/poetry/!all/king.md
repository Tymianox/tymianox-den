his reign unmoved
by the raging fire

his murky face
like a stone stays

as the kingdom
slowly crumbles

the country he built
is in shambles

what will he do
knowing the future

if the future is now


will this kingdom
survive the attack

will the bigger one
win all the time

we will see in time...
