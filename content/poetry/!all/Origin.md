   In a fit of rage
   I write this
   So you may hear it
   And make a change

God in his holy mercifullness
Made us from simple clay
Formed us with his own two hands
And gave us the shape we have

But being blinded for a moment
His hand slipped - we are flawed
From clay we were made
And shit we became

Making us mortal did not help
If not to God, we're assholes to all else

We keep raping & murdering &
We keep on bullying
We lie to gods &
We lie to ourselves

We humuliate & degrade

We talk before we think &
We talk what we don't think
We fake love &
We fake our lives

We shame & blame

We hurt others &
We hurt ourselves
We break promises &
We break hearts

We pray & slay

We torture mankind &
We torture Mother Earth

I fear to imagine
What would happen if
We forgot about Hell
