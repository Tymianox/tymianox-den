Goodbye world
Who could have foretold
So early demise
And of such size

I'm sorry - ones I loved
From the depths of my
Broken heart
But loved not like a lover
That's much lower
Loved like a lost soul
Who seeks it's goal
Please don't forget
Your dreams
Let them flow
Like streams
Only thing I regret
Is not being able
To fulfill them

To everyone else
See you never
Dream on & f*** you
I wish you - not Hell
That's where mine rings bell
You can land in Heaven, Valhalla
Or the Underworld for all I care
Your punishment is on it's way
Either way
No point running away
It'll find you - it has it's ways
Neither praying nor killing
Will help you now

All I wanted was peace
Didn't even get a piece


A heart for you a heart for me,
No one loves me except for tea
