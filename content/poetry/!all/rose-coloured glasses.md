rose-coloured glasses  
make the world change in hue  
yet still this pinkish world  
is equally bleak and blue  
  
these lenses promise comfort  
a refuge from the grey  
but all they do is make you think  
that all is right when it is grey  
  
through tinted glasses,  
the cracks still show, they always do  
you see the world in the shades of blush  
but the darkness remains unfazed  
  
so take back your tinted blinders  
your pastel-coloured liesâ€”  
they donâ€™t hide the emptiness  
or even silence all the cries
