letâ€™s never meet againâ€”  
not in the quiet spaces  
where memories rest like dust  
or in dreams that wake us  
with echoes of what once was us  
  
letâ€™s not cross paths  
on the pages of old letters  
in whispered words  
or the crumbling bridges  
that we burned to nothing but embers  
  
letâ€™s not see each other  
in strangers' faces or  
in moments when the air grows still  
bringing with it the scent of your perfume  
that lingers longer than it should  
  
letâ€™s never meet againâ€”  
itâ€™s better this way  
to stay as memories untangled, repressed  
as hearts that might heal in due time  
as strangers who once danced together,  
yet separate somehow
