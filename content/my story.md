I'm 18
I was born in 2005 on a cold winter night, maybe that heralded my future. And then there's emptiness. No memories. And the emptiness hurts. Only thing I really remember is that I was bullied in school. All the usual: being a nerd, quiet, dressing "weirdly". I also remember a few slices thanks to photos, but you could show me a fake one and I wouldn't notice.
After that I was homeschooled, went to music school, English and French classes, judo, horseback riding, my parents forced me into scouting. No friends to be seen.

My memories kind of regain traction around two years ago.
But it's still only a few slices here and there. Maybe my brain decided it's better not to get attached to the past. That's why I keep a very basic diary and take lots of photos, especially with the few friends I have, I cherish all of them deeply even thought it doesn't look like it.

A few snapshots from summer camp in 2021. It was nice. Quiet before the storm.

And then at the end of 2021 everything slowly started to fall apart, not that it was ever in good shape, and in January everything came to a stop and my first depression episode started. What can I say? It almost ended with me with a knife in my chest, but my body stopped me, I wasn't able to kill myself. Yaaay ðŸ˜’

Later there was winter camp, and I got to know the only two people I can call friends, let's call them Y and Z. And it was great, I think it was the best winter camp I ever had, even with depression still looming over me.

Stressing over exams, barely getting through to the next class.

Becoming atheist.

Another summer camp, it went ok.

You can see for yourself how bad my lack of memories is. Who even am I without them?

It's been like three hours of me laying unmoving in bed trying to remember anything.

There was some more deep depression in between, apathy, depersonalization, derealization, emptiness, despair, sleepless nights, a few anxiety attacks, I don't even want to remember what else.

Winter camp, fine.

Dropping school, against every-fucking-one telling me not to. 

Y and Z have been my support, at least until Y started hurting both of us, they're sorry but we're not sure what to do with this. I want everything to be fine, but should I?

Z still keeps me going, they are the only person I know I can count on, the only one I can talk to, the only one that understand me, the ONLY one I trust.

I don't know what else to write, why am I even writing this, I want to go to a therapist but I can't, I'm scared.

I want to do, I want to feel, I want to help, I want to live. I want to have friends, fulfill dreams I had, enjoy life. But I can't. I just can't. The most I can do is to exist from moment to moment. Look emotionlessly at days passing by. I won't kill myself because I can't, I guess I haven't been hurt enough just yet. But what else can I do? Right now I don't feel like there's anything I can do.
