I don't know what's real and what a dream, I think it's all a dream but I'm scared, what if it's all true? My whole room was full of piles of junk, there was a wall dividing it and I had a fight with my parents, warned mom not to say something she'll regret, made a mess of the junk, killed some animals and had worms/larvae talk to me. Also I think I really have them in my pee box, they just don't talk. Oh and in reality a made the hibernacula t1 challenge. Now even wind outside gives me anxiety.
