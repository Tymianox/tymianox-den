# Neutron star
![[Neutron Star Cross-section.png]]
A neutron star is an extremely dense stellar remnant formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova and its core collapses under gravity. Composed almost entirely of neutrons, it has a radius of only about 10–20 km but a mass greater than that of the Sun, resulting in densities so high that a teaspoon of its matter would weigh billions of tons. Neutron stars are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure and strong nuclear forces.

Neutron stars can exhibit different behaviors and are classified into subtypes:

- **[[Pulsar|Pulsars]]** – Highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation.
    
- **[[Magnetar|Magnetars]]** – Neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic fields, capable of releasing intense bursts of X-rays and gamma rays.
    
- **[[X-ray binary|X-ray binaries]]** – Systems where a neutron star accretes matter from a companion star, emitting X-rays.
    
- **[[Rotating radio transient|Rotating radio transients (RRATs)]]** – Neutron stars emitting sporadic radio bursts.
    
- **[[Millisecond pulsar|Milisecond pulsars]]** – Pulsars spinning hundreds of times per second, often spun up through accretion from a companion.
    

These exotic objects are crucial to understanding matter under extreme pressures, stellar evolution, and the limits of physical laws.
