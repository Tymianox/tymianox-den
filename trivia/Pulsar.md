# Pulsar
A pulsar is a highly magnetized, rotating [[neutron star]] that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation from its magnetic poles. As the star spins, these beams sweep across space like a lighthouse, and if they cross Earth’s line of sight, they are detected as regular pulses of radiation, often in the radio spectrum but sometimes in X-rays or gamma rays. Pulsars are incredibly precise timekeepers, with rotation periods ranging from milliseconds to a few seconds, gradually slowing over time as they lose energy.

Pulsars form when a massive star undergoes a supernova, leaving behind a dense, rapidly spinning neutron star with a strong magnetic field. Some pulsars, called **[[Millisecond pulsar|milisecond pulsars]]**, rotate hundreds of times per second, often “recycled” through accretion from a companion star. Pulsars are valuable in astrophysics for testing theories of gravity, studying extreme states of matter, and even searching for gravitational waves.
