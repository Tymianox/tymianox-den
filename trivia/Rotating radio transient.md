# Rotating radio transient
A rotating radio transient (RRAT) is a type of [[neutron star]] that emits brief, irregular bursts of radio waves rather than the steady, periodic signals typical of most [[pulsar|pulsars]]. First identified in 2006 through reanalysis of pulsar survey data, RRATs can emit bursts lasting only a few milliseconds, separated by intervals ranging from minutes to hours. Between bursts, they are usually undetectable, making them challenging to discover and study. The exact cause of their sporadic emission is still uncertainâ€”possibilities include extreme pulsar emission variability, interaction with surrounding material, or magnetospheric instabilities. RRATs expand our understanding of neutron star populations and suggest that many more neutron stars may exist undetected due to their intermittent nature.
