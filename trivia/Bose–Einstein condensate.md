# Bose–Einstein condensate
![[Bose-Einstein Condensate.webm]]
A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter formed when a group of bosons—particles with integer spin—are cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero (near 0 Kelvin). At such ultra-low temperatures, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the same quantum ground state, causing quantum effects to appear on a macroscopic scale. This results in a single quantum entity that exhibits properties like superfluidity and coherence. Predicted by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in the 1920s, BECs were first created experimentally in 1995 with rubidium atoms. These condensates provide valuable insights into quantum mechanics, allowing scientists to study quantum phenomena that are otherwise difficult to observe. BECs have applications in precision measurements, quantum computing research, and understanding fundamental physics.
