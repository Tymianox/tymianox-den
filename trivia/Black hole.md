# Black hole
![[Black_hole.jpg]]
A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape its pull. They form from the remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity after exhausting their nuclear fuel, or through other processes like merging of dense objects or primordial formation in the early universe. The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon — the point of no return. Inside, matter collapses into a singularity, a point of infinite density where current physics breaks down.

Black holes come in several types based on mass and formation:

- **Stellar black holes** – Formed from collapsing massive stars, typically a few to tens of solar masses.
    
- **Supermassive black holes** – Millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun, found in the centers of galaxies.
    
- **Intermediate black holes** – Hypothetical mid-sized black holes, possibly formed by merging smaller black holes.
    
- **Primordial black holes** – Hypothetical black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang.

### Theories about Black Holes and Their Nature

- **Classical General Relativity View:** Black holes are defined by their event horizons and singularities where density becomes infinite and known laws of physics cease to apply. The singularity is hidden by the event horizon, making it impossible to observe directly.
    
- **Information Paradox and Quantum Mechanics:** Stephen Hawking showed that black holes can emit radiation (Hawking radiation) due to quantum effects near the event horizon, which implies black holes can slowly evaporate. This leads to the information paradox — a puzzle about whether information swallowed by black holes is lost forever, challenging the principles of quantum mechanics.
    
- **Firewall Hypothesis:** Proposes that an energetic "firewall" exists at the event horizon, destroying anything that tries to pass through, contradicting the classical idea that crossing the horizon is uneventful.
    
- **Fuzzball Theory:** Suggests black holes are actually “fuzzballs” with no singularity; instead, they have a complex quantum structure that replaces the classical singularity, preserving information.
    
- **Black Hole Complementarity:** Argues that observers outside and inside a black hole experience different realities, but no contradiction arises because no observer can confirm both views simultaneously.
    

Black holes remain one of the most intriguing subjects in modern physics, as their study pushes the boundaries between general relativity and quantum theory.
