# Degenerate matter
Degenerate matter is an extremely dense state of matter typically found in the cores of collapsed stars, such as white dwarfs and neutron stars. It arises when the pressure supporting the matter comes not from heat or chemical bonds but from quantum mechanical effects—specifically the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents identical fermions (like electrons or neutrons) from occupying the same quantum state. This creates a "degeneracy pressure" that counteracts gravitational collapse. There are different types of degenerate matter, including electron-degenerate matter (in white dwarfs) and neutron-degenerate matter (in neutron stars). Degenerate matter does not behave like ordinary gases or solids and has unique properties, such as being incompressible beyond certain limits. It plays a key role in astrophysics, explaining the stability of certain stellar remnants and the limits to which stars can collapse before forming black holes.
