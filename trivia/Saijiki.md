A _saijiki_ is a Japanese reference book that organizes _kigo_â€”seasonal words used in haiku and other forms of traditional Japanese poetry. It typically groups these words by season and provides their meanings, cultural associations, and examples of poems in which they are used. The purpose of a saijiki is to guide poets in selecting appropriate _kigo_ to evoke a particular season and its associated imagery, helping maintain the seasonal and cultural depth central to classical haiku. Modern saijiki may also include photographs, illustrations, and historical notes. While originating in Japan, similar reference works exist in other languages for poets interested in haiku outside of Japanese traditions.
