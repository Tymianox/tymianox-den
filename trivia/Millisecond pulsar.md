# Millisecond pulsar
A millisecond pulsar is a type of [[neutron star]] that rotates hundreds of times per second, with rotational periods typically between 1 and 10 milliseconds. Like other [[Pulsar|pulsars]], they emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their magnetic poles, which are detected as rapid pulses when the beam sweeps past Earth. Millisecond pulsars are thought to form through a “recycling” process in which an old neutron star in a binary system accretes matter from its companion, gaining angular momentum and spinning up to extreme speeds. This accretion can also reduce the pulsar’s magnetic field strength, making it more stable and allowing it to maintain rapid rotation for billions of years. Millisecond pulsars are valuable tools in astrophysics, used for precise tests of general relativity, studying binary star evolution, and even detecting gravitational waves through pulsar timing arrays.
