![[HeLa Cells.jpg]]
HeLa cells are an immortal cell line used extensively in scientific research, originally derived from cervical cancer cells taken from Henrietta Lacks in 1951 without her knowledge or consent. They were the first human cells successfully cultured and propagated indefinitely in vitro, revolutionizing medical and biological research. These cells have contributed to numerous scientific breakthroughs, including the development of the polio vaccine, cancer research, AIDS studies, and gene mapping. Due to their robust growth and durability, HeLa cells have also raised ethical questions about patient rights and consent in biomedical research. Despite being contaminated or misidentified in many labs over time, HeLa cells remain one of the most widely used and studied cell lines worldwide.
