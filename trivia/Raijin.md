# Raijin
![[Raijin.jpg]]
Raijin is the Japanese god of thunder, lightning, and storms, venerated in Shinto and Buddhist traditions. Often depicted as a fierce, muscular figure surrounded by drums that he strikes to create thunder, Raijin is both feared and respected for his power over destructive weather. In art, he is frequently shown alongside his brother or companion Fūjin, the god of wind. Raijin is sometimes portrayed as a guardian deity, using storms to ward off evil spirits, but in other tales he is a chaotic force causing devastation. His legends often intertwine with agricultural themes, as storms could both nourish crops with rain or destroy them with their violence. Raijin is also connected with the mythical creature raijū, said to be his companion.
