Greenland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, particularly among young Inuit men. Rates are especially elevated in small, remote settlements. Several factors contribute to this crisis: historical trauma from colonization, rapid cultural change, displacement, loss of traditional lifestyles, and intergenerational trauma. Social issues such as unemployment, substance abuse, family violence, and limited access to mental health services exacerbate the problem. Feelings of isolation, hopelessness, and lack of purpose are frequently reported.

Common methods of suicide in Greenland include hanging and firearms, with access to guns being widespread in hunting communities. The high lethality of these methods contributes to the elevated fatality rate.

Prevention strategies have included public awareness campaigns, school-based education, suicide prevention hotlines, restricting access to firearms, community support programs, and training local health workers in suicide intervention. Efforts have also focused on strengthening cultural identity and fostering connections between generations to provide a sense of belonging and resilience.
