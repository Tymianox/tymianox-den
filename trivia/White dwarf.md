# White dwarf
![[White dwarf.jpg]]
A white dwarf is the dense, compact remnant of a star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel and expelled its outer layers, typically after passing through the red giant phase. Composed mostly of [[Degenerate matter|electron-degenerate matter]], white dwarfs are supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. They usually have a mass comparable to the Sun but a volume similar to Earth’s, making them incredibly dense.

White dwarfs slowly cool and fade over billions of years, eventually becoming black dwarfs (theoretical, as none are believed to exist yet due to the universe’s age). Some white dwarfs are part of binary systems where accretion of matter can trigger novae or even Type Ia [[Supernova|supernovae]], which are important cosmic distance markers.

Their study provides key insights into stellar evolution, matter under extreme conditions, and the ultimate fate of many stars.
