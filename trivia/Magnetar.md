# Magnetar
![[Magnetar.jpg]]
A magnetar is a type of [[neutron star]] with an extraordinarily powerful magnetic field—typically a thousand times stronger than that of a typical neutron star and over a quadrillion times stronger than Earth's. These magnetic fields can reach up to about 10¹⁵ gauss, influencing the star’s structure, radiation, and surrounding space. Magnetars are believed to form from massive stars that collapse in supernovae, where rapid rotation and convection amplify their magnetic fields.

Magnetars are known for their unpredictable high-energy outbursts, releasing intense X-rays and gamma rays that can briefly outshine an entire galaxy. Their magnetic fields gradually decay over tens of thousands of years, powering their emissions. They are thought to be the source of phenomena such as soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), both explained as different observational states of magnetars.

Because of their rarity and extreme physics, magnetars provide valuable insights into matter under extreme magnetic and gravitational forces.
