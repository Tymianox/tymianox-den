# Supernova
![[Supernova SNR E0519-69.0.jpg]]
A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion that occurs during the final stages of a star’s life cycle, releasing an immense amount of energy—briefly outshining entire galaxies. Supernovae play a critical role in enriching the universe with heavy elements and triggering the formation of new stars. There are two primary types:

- **Type I** – Caused by a [[White dwarf|white dwarf]] in a binary system accumulating matter from its companion until it reaches a critical mass, leading to runaway nuclear fusion.
    
- **Type II** – The result of the gravitational collapse of a massive star’s core after it exhausts its nuclear fuel, typically leaving behind a [[neutron star]] or [[Black hole|black hole]].
    

Subclasses, such as Type Ib, Ic, and IIb, are distinguished by the presence or absence of certain elements in their spectra. Supernovae are not only essential to cosmic evolution but also serve as important distance markers in astronomy, especially Type Ia supernovae, which are used as standard candles to measure cosmic expansion.
