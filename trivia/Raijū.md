![[Raijuu.jpg]]
The raijū is a creature from Japanese mythology associated with thunder, lightning, and storms. Its name means "thunder animal," and it is said to take the form of various animals such as a fox, cat, weasel, or wolf, sometimes even appearing as a ball of lightning or fire. The raijū is considered the companion or servant of the thunder god Raijin, often leaping about during storms and causing lightning strikes. Legends claim that during thunderstorms, it may rest inside a sleeping person’s belly, prompting Raijin to strike with lightning to wake it. This belief was sometimes used to explain deaths caused by lightning. While often harmless unless provoked, the raijū’s sudden appearances and electric nature made it a symbol of awe and fear in folklore.
