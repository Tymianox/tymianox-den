# Aphantasia
![[Aphantasia.png]]
Aphantasia [/ˌæfænˈteɪʒə/] is a condition where a person is unable to voluntarily visualize mental images. People with aphantasia do not create pictures in their mind’s eye, which can affect memory, imagination, and dreaming. The term was coined in 2015, though the phenomenon was described earlier. It is estimated that around 2–3% of the population has aphantasia. Despite lacking mental imagery, many individuals with aphantasia can still think, dream, and solve problems effectively, showing that visualization is not essential for creativity or intelligence. Research on aphantasia sheds light on how diverse human cognition can be and challenges assumptions about the universality of mental imagery.
