# X-ray binary
An X-ray binary is a binary star system composed of a normal star and a compact object such as a [[neutron star]] or [[Black hole]]. In these systems, matter from the normal star is pulled toward the compact object by gravity, forming an accretion disk. As this matter spirals inward and heats up to millions of degrees, it emits strong X-rays, making these systems bright X-ray sources. X-ray binaries are classified into two main types based on the mass of the donor star:

- **High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs):** Donor star is a massive, young star (often O or B type).
- **Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs):** Donor star is smaller and older, usually similar in mass to the Sun or less.

X-ray binaries are valuable astrophysical laboratories for studying accretion physics, relativistic jets, and the behavior of matter in extreme gravitational fields.
