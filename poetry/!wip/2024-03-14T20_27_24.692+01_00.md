Stop screaming, it's just a hot (iron) shower.

One more splinter in your hand, hundreds more scoops to go.

Smell of fried meat fills the house, only disruption - butt in the counter.

ðŸŽ¶ Ram pam pam, my life is cleaning pipes. ðŸŽ¶
ðŸŽ¶ Wiping blood off of cast iron pipes. ðŸŽ¶

Before I could sit, my foot slipped (I should have wiped my wellingtons better). The pole impaled the car and me.
