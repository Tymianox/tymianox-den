I walk through the forest, looking for my love
I walk through the forest, searching for what I lost
I walk through the forest, where our story's told
I walk through the forest, with steps full of hope,

I walk through the forest, searching through the trees,
Hoping for a sign, a whisper in the breeze.
I walk through the forest, where our footsteps crossed,
In this tangled wilderness, our love was nearly lost.

	Ref.
	d a C C7
	d a C E
	I'll never give up, I'll keep searching through the night,
	For in this darkened woodland, I'll find our love's true light.

I'll follow the moonbeams, and the stars up high,
Guided by their shimmer, I won't say goodbye.
I walk through the forest, with a heart so strong,
Knowing that our love will bring me back where I belong.

Through the rustling leaves, a whisper in the breeze
I remember your smile, how it put my soul at ease
In the silence of the night, I hear your voice so clear
Calling me to find you, banish all my fear

I'll keep on walking, through the darkest hours,
Battling all the thorns and the hidden wildflowers.
Through the tangled vines, and the rivers we once crossed
I'll keep on searching, no matter what the cost

	As I walk through the forest, guided by the dove,
	I'll find you, my dear, and forever we will love.
